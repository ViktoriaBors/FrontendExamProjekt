# Exam Project

## Prooktatas Full-stack Developer bootcamp - **FRONT END MODULE**

### **_Introduction_**

During the 3 months front end module, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Moreover I dig deep in to Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript DOM manipulations already.

In this exam project, there were some small requirements (such as the website must have a form, a menu etc). but creativity had no limit.

### **_The Projects itself_**

The local LGTB+ community has a one and only bookstore/cafe in whole Nordjylland, Denmark. I decided to use their concepts and make an alternative webpage for them.

### **_Used Technologies_**

1. HTML
2. CSS / SASS
3. Bootstrap 5
4. JavaScript

**Aim of the project**

To use all (and more) of the knowledge what I have learned during the course, including animation, form sending, book site pagination and a little color game.

**Challenges within the project**

1. Pagination - DOM manipulation was a hard part of this project in the booklist. Why? Probably because my JavaScript knowledge was not enough, but I did not give up and tried my best to make it work.
2. Webaccessibility - Reaching all the feature just with keyboard was challenging f.e. at the menucard animation

### **_What have I learned?_**

I learned to make a static website from scratch. I gained experience working with Bootstrap and SASS. I have put all my JavaScript knowledge what I had that time.
